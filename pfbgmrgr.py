pfBgMrgr_manual = '''# Introduction

pfBgMrgr is a CLI tool to merge a multipage document with one or two background files as a digital substitute for preprinted letter paper.
It is designed to be used with the profacto ERP-software from extragroup GmbH (extragroup.de) on the OS X and Windows Version 6.1 or 6.2 platform.

## Requirements

In order to use it Python 2.7 is required, other versions of Python may work as well but are not tested or supported.
In addition the pyPdf module is needed as well. Just place the module filder beside the pfBgMrgr.py file.

Download from here: "https://github.com/mfenniak/pyPdf" or search on the web.

# Usage

python pfBgMrgr.py [Options] Args

Use "python pfBgMrgr.py --help" to show the availabale options. The options "--help" and "--version" will not process any given arguments, but print their information and exit.

You need to provide pfBgMrgr.py with at least two but at most three arguments, otherwise it will exit with an error.

* The first argument is the pdf-file without the background. Take care that it has a completely transparent background otherwise it will hide the background file, avoid fully coloured text fields or tables if the will overlap graphical or textual content of your backgrounds.

* The second argument is the first pdf file for your background. If only this is given it will be used for the entire document.
* The third argument is the optional pdf file to use as background for all pages from second to last. This allows you to use a different Design for the first page than for the following ones.

The backgroundfiles may have more than one page, nonetheless only the first page of both pdf will be used only.

## Pathes

The path to the three files need to be fully qualified paths, or relative to the path where pfBgMrgr.py is executed from.

## Pagesize

You may use a different size for all three files though this is not recommended, there is no scaling automatism or rotation whatsoever implemented and will never be. So for best results use for all three pdfs the same pagesize and layout.

## Performance

Reading, merging and recompiling, and writing a PDF of many pages with possibly high resolution content may take some time depending on your hardware.
